# CANBadger Server
The CANBadgers best friend!

# Quickstart
Unpack the binaries and run the program.
The binaries come with all required libraries and are tested on ubuntu and windows.
If you want to write your custom python script to talk to the CanBadger, have a look at the [examples](https://github.com/Gutenshit/CANBadger-Server/tree/master/examples)

# Run from source
Required packages: python2, pyqt
Additional packages for development: pyqt-tools, qtcreator (for editing the .ui files), pip
Example installation in ubuntu:
```
sudo apt-get intall python-pip python-qt4 pyqt4-dev-tools qtcreator
sudo pip install bitstring
```
Then, just clone this repo and hack away
