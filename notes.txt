- LPC XPresso Free Edition is good3
- Use Xpresso LPC1769 board, plug and play on os x
- to import mbed projects: "import" from the quickstart bar
- to compile with ethernet and rtos libs:

# EthernetManager
Concept:
It will use UDP for lightweight data transmission -> should be reliable enough, as we have ethernet
There will be two different "channels"
- The first one will be the Discovery Channel -> broadcast uid to port so software can identify nodes
  - use dst port 13370 for broadcast packets
- the second one will be the Config/action/data Channel
  - listen on port 13371
  - for configuration:
    - action = connect : port
    - action = config
    - data = key:value
  - for other actions:
    - action = (replay, filter, or some other shit)
    - data = packet (-sequence) to replay/some other shit
  - once enabled through CONNECT, send packet data to dst port specified in connect action
  - all replies come from here
  - everything network related runs in the main thread
  - interrupt will set flags for sending broadcasts
